# How to

For now, the best way, is to clone [gatsby storyblok boilerplate](https://github.com/marckraw/gatsby-storyblok-boilerplate), create components, test them there, and then duplicate `text-block` folder from `@storyblok-components`. Rename it, and change content with your tested components. Then make a PR.
